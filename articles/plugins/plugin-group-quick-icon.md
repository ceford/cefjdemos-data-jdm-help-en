## Group Description

Quick Icons appear in panels in the Home Dashboard to provide easy visual access to Joomla features as an alternative to using the Administrator Menus. Some of the Quick Icons obtain additional information after initial display. The plugins are used to obtain that additional information. For example, this is the Update Checks panel showing that two Extension updates are available.

If you watch page load or reload carefully you will see the icons change colour from blue to green or red, signifying up to date or not up to date. If you disable a plugin it will not appear on the Home Dashboard.
