## Description

Banners are blocks of content containing advertising information. Each
banner has a Client, the person paying for the information, and a Track
record, the number of times the banner has been selected. A site may
have several banners in different locations. The Banners screen shows a
list of existing Banners with links to edit current and create new
Banners. There must be at least one Banner Client and one Banner
Category **before** a Banner can be created.

## Column Headers

The following columns are specific to Banners.

- **Pinned**.  If one or more Banners in a Category are pinned, they will take
    priority over Banners that are not pinned. For example, if two Banners in
    a Category are pinned and a third Banner is not pinned, the third Banner
    will not display if the module setting is 'Pinned, Randomise'. Only the
    two pinned Banners will display.

    If the pinned banners have a fixed
    number of impressions, once those impressions are used up, the pinned
    banners will no longer display, and the non-pinned banners will begin
    displaying automatically.
- **Client.** The Client for this Banner. Clients are entered from the
    Banners: Clients list.
- **Impressions.** The Impression count is the number of times the
    Banner has been displayed on a page. The first number in this column
    is the actual number of Impressions so far, and the second number is
    how many Impressions were purchased by the client.
- **Clicks.** The first number is the total number of clicks that have
    been made on the Banner since the counter was reset. The second number
    is what percentage of the time user clicked on the banner when it was
    displayed.

## Quick Tips

- You must add at least one Banner Client and Banner Category *before* you
can add a Banner.
