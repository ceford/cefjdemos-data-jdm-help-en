<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Banners:_Categories / Display title: Banners: Categories -->

## Description

Categories are are used to organise Banners for ease of management and display.
They can be built into tree-like structures like file systems. Every Banner
must be assigned to a Category. The default is Uncategorised.

The Categories list page is used to manage categories. That includes creation
of new categories, finding categories to edit and changing category properties
such as published or not and category order. Also, some properties may be
changed for a group of categories using a Batch Process.

There must be at least one Banner Client and Banner Category **before** a
Banner can be created.
