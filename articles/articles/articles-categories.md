Something different. 

## Description

Categories are are used to organise Articles for ease of management and
display. They can be built into tree-like structures like file systems. Every
Article must be assigned to a Category. The default is *Uncategorised*.

The **Categories** list page is used to manage categories. That includes
creation of new categories, finding categories to edit and changing category
properties such as published or not and category order. Also, some properties
may be changed for a group of categories using a Batch Process.
