<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Articles / Display title: Articles -->

## Description

In Joomla!, an Article is a self-contained unit of written information for
display on the website. It normally contains text and may contain pictures
and other types of content. For many Joomla! sites, articles form the majority
of the information presented.

It is important to understand that the content of the site is totally separate
from the formatting of the site, the way it looks on the page. So it is best
to think of Articles as pure content independent of presentation. The same
Article might be shown with different fonts, colours, headings, and background,
and might be shown in different locations on the page, all depending on other
settings in the Joomla! CMS.

The **Articles** list page is used to manage articles. That includes creation
of new articles, finding articles to edit and changing article properties
such as published or not and featured or not. Also, some properties may be
changed for a group of articles using a Batch Process.

### Common Elements

Some elements of the Articles list page are covered in separate Help articles:

* [Toolbars](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/toolbars "").
* [List Filters](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/list-filters "").
* [List Column Headers](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/list-column-headers "").
* [List Item Ordering](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/list-ordering "").
* [List Pagination](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/list-pagination "").
* [List Batch Process](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/list-batch-process "").

## How to Access
