## Tips

- There are 2 methods to insert an image into article using the TinyMCE editor.
  1. The *CMS Content* dropdown list provides access to the Media screen.
  2. The *Insert* dropdown list is a simple form for which requires the image
    url. It is used for external images.
- A *Read More* insert saves space on any Featured or Blog layout page by
  showing just the first portion of an Article. *Page Break* inserts
  provide multi-page navigation for long articles. Both may be used in a single
  article if desired. For example, a *Read More* break could be placed after the
  first paragraph and *Page Break* breaks could be placed after later groups of
  paragraphs to create a multi-page article. No page navigation would display
  on the Featured or Blog page until the User selects the Read more link. At
  that time, the Article's table of contents would display showing links to
  every page.
