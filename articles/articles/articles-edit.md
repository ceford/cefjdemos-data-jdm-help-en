## Description

This page is used to add a new article or edit an existing article, usually
using a Wysiwyg editor. The default editor is TinyMCE but if other
editors are installed the default editor may be set to something else
for the site as a whole or for individual users.

Most parameters in the *Article: Edit* page have suitable defaults but you
might wish to set a specific Category or provide article-specific Metadata.

## Quick Tips

- There are 2 methods to insert an image into article using the TinyMCE
  editor.
  1.  The CMS Content
      dropdown list provides access to the Media screen
      that lets you browse image files and upload images.
  2.  The 'Insert' dropdown list is a simple form for which you need to
      know the image url. It is used for external images.
- **Read more**  breaks allow you to save space on the Front Page or on any
  blog layout page by showing just the first portion of an Article. Page break
  allow you to provide multi-page navigation for long Articles. You can
  use both on one Article, if desired.For example, you could put a Read
  more break after the first paragraph of a multi-page article, and have
  Page breaks after each page. No page navigation would display on the
  Front Page until the User selects the Read more link. At that time,
  the Article's table of contents would display showing links to every
  page.
