<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Guided_Tours / Display title: Guided Tours -->

## Description

The guided tours give users the ability to complete walk-throughs (or tours)
to better understand the interface they are learning to use. Each tour has
mandatory associated steps. Joomla comes with built-in tours, a good starting
point to create new tours.
