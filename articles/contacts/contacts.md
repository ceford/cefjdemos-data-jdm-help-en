## Description

Contacts allow you to list people and their personal information on your
web site, not necessarily registered users. You may also allow anyone,
or just registered users, to send e-mails to those people.

The Contacts list shows selected information for contacts and provides
links to edit or add information such as name, address, phone and
e-mail. You can also link contacts to registered users. Afterwards, you
can use the Menu list to create front-end links to the the contacts.
