## Tips

- If you are a beginning user, you can just keep the default values here
  until you learn more about using global options.
- If you are an advanced user, you can save time by creating good
  default values here. When you set up menu items and create contacts,
  you will be able to accept the default values for most options.
- All values set here can be overridden at the menu item, category, or
  contact level.
