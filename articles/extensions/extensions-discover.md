<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Extensions:_Discover / Display title: Extensions: Discover -->

## Description

This page allows you to discover extensions that have not passed through
the normal installation process. For example, some extensions are too large
in file size to upload using the web interface due to limitations of the web
hosting environment. Using this feature you can upload extension files directly
to your web server using some other means such as FTP or SFTP and place those
extension files into the appropriate directory. You can then use the
discover feature to find the newly uploaded extension and activate it in
your Joomla! installation. Using the discover operation you can also
discover and install multiple extensions at the same time. An extension
can be installed with the discover function and the following steps:

1.  Upload the uncompressed extension files to the appropriate directory
    in your Joomla! installation. For example, if you wanted to upload a
    site template extension to your Joomla! installation you would
    create a directory for the template extension in the /templates
    sub-directory of your Joomla! installation. Then you would upload
    the template extension files into that directory.
2.  After you have uploaded the extension files, go back to the
    Extension Manager Discover page and select the **Discover** button
    in the toolbar. This will initiate the search function which will
    search your Joomla! extension directories looking for uninstalled
    extensions.
3.  If the extension you uploaded is compatible with your Joomla! version and
    is not already installed, it will appear in the listing of
    discovered extensions in this page.
4.  Check the check-box to the left of the discovered extension and then
    select the **Install** button in the toolbar. This will install the
    extension into your Joomla! installation.

  then use this screen to discover all of them in one operation. You can
  then install all of the extensions in one step by selecting all of
  them and selecting the **Install** button in the toolbar.
