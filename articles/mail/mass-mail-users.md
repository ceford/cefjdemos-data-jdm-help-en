## Details and Message

- **Mail to Child Groups.** Whether or not to send the Email to members
  of all child groups of the selected group. For example, if this box is
  checked and the "Public" group is selected, the email would be sent to
  all users, since all groups are child groups of "Public".
- **Send in HTML mode.** Whether or not to send the Email with headers
  that identify it as an HTML document. Email clients that support this
  will render any HTML codes.
- **Send to Disabled Users.** If checked, disabled users will be
  included when sending mail.
- **Recipients as BCC.** If checked, all recipients will be included as
  BCC entries, so none will see any of the other recipients' Email
  addresses. Because many mail routers treat Email without a *To:* entry
  as spam, the site email will be used for the *To:* entry.
- **Group.** Select the groups you want to send the Email to.
- **Subject** Enter the Subject of the Email. Try to make it as
  descriptive as possible. Any text entered in the *Subject Prefix*
  parameter in Options (User Options → Mass Mail)
  will be placed in front of the subject you enter here.
- **Message.** Enter the body of the Email. Any text entered in the
  *Mailbody Suffix* parameter in Options (User Options → Mass Mail)
  will be added to the text you enter here.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
Screenshot above. The functions are:

- **Send email**. Send the email and return to the main Mass Mail screen
- **Cancel**. Closes the current screen and returns to the previous
  screen without saving any modifications you may have made.
- **Options.** Opens the Options window where settings such as default
  parameters can be edited.
- **Help**. Opens this help screen.
