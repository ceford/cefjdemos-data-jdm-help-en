    A hidden message cannot be restored in Joomla. If necessary, it can be restored
    in the database.
- **Archive** When selected the panel content is hidden and the button replaced
    with a green **Read Again** button.

- **Hide All Messages.** Select this button to hide the messages in the
  left panel. The messages are replaced by a box that says ***You have
  read all the messages***. There is a ***Reset Messages*** button that
  restores the unread messages, including the individually hidden
  messages.
- **Options.** Opens the Options window where settings such as default
  parameters can be edited.
