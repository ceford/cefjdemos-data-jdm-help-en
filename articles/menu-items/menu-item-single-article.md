## Quick Tips

- If you have a Single Article Layout defined for an article, that
  layout will show any time a user drills down to that article. For
  example, if an article is shown on another menu item type (for
  example, in a Category Blog or List Layout or a Featured Articles
  Layout), the user will be taken to the Single Article Layout for that
  article (if defined).
- Archived articles are no longer published but are still stored on the
  site. Articles are Archived using the Articles screen. Note that
  Articles assigned to the 'Uncategorised' Section will not show on the
  Archived Article List layout.
