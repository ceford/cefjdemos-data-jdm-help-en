<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Multilingual_Associations:_Edit / Display title: Multilingual Associations: Edit -->

## Description

The *Multilingual Associations: Edit Associations* page shows a Reference item
and a Target item side by side in wider screens and stacked in narrow screens.
The side by side mode allows you to align the reference and target for ease
of translation.

The fields in the Reference and Target are the same as those in the edit form
for a single item but the layout is adjusted for the restricted column width.

### Common Elements

Some elements of this page are covered in separate Help articles:

* [Toolbars](jdocmanual?article=help/common-elements/toolbars).

## How to Access

* Select **Components → Multilingual Associations** from the Administrator menu.
  * Select an **Item Type** from the *- Select Item Type -* dropdown list.
  * Select **Language** from the *- Select Language -* dropdown list. This 
    becomes the Reference language.
* To edit an Association: Select a Target language from the **Associated** column.
* To add an Association: Select a Target language from the **Not Associated** column.
