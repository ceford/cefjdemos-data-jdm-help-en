<!-- Filename: Help4.x:List_Column_Headers / Display title: List Column Headers -->

## Purpose

Column Headers appear in list views to indicate the nature of the information
in that column. The headers vary from component to component. Many column
headers can be used to sort the list on that column but this is not always
the case. For example, in Category list views the four *State* columns are
not used for ordering as all of the items in those columns have the same
state.

## Some examples

### The Users list Column Headers

## Order by Column

To change the list order select the column list ordering icon. In a column not
being used for ordering this is a double up/down chevron
(<span class="ms-1 icon-sort" aria-hidden="true"></span>).
For the column used for ordering it is either an up chevron
(<span class="ms-1 icon-caret-up" aria-hidden="true"></span>) or down chevron
(<span class="ms-1 icon-caret-down" aria-hidden="true"></span>) to indicate
the current ordering direction, ascending or descending.

## Some Common Headers

- **Checkbox** To select all articles, check the box in the column heading.
    The toolbar button 'Actions' becomes active. An action may be applied to the
    items visible in the page. It is not applied to items in subsequent pages
    that are not visible.
- **Ordering** You can change the order of an article within a list as
    follows:
  - In the Filter Options limit the list to items to be ordered, for example
    items in a selected Language or items by a selected Author.
  - Select the ordering icon <i class="fa-solid fa-sort"></i> in the first
    column heading to make it active.
  - Select one of the vertical ellipsis icons <span class="icon-ellipsis-v"></span>
    that appear when ordering is active and drag it up or down to change the
    position of that row in the list.
- **Title** or **Name** The title of the item is usually a link to the
    *Edit* page for that item.
- **ID** A unique identification number for this article. It cannot be changed.
