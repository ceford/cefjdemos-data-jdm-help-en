<!-- Filename: Help6.x:List_Pagination / Display title: List Pagination -->

## PurposeÂ¶

Most components have list views that display items from the database. There
may be hundreds of items, thousands perhaps, or even millions. The default
*List Limit*, the number of items shown in a page of results, is usually 20.
Beneath each page of results, if there are more results than the current limit,
you will find a *Pagination* bar:

![Articles list pagination bar](../../../en/images/common-elements/articles-list-pagination-bar.png "")

With the first number in the Pagination bar selected, the first 20 results will
be displayed in the list, or whatever number of results the List Limit has been
set to. Select the next number or the Next icon
(<span class="icon-angle-right"></span>) to move on to the next page of items.

The maximum number of pages displayed in a single pagination bar is 10.
However, page numbers below and above the curren page are displayed to make
it easy to move on or move back a page at a time.

Here is a screenshot of the Plugins list having moved on to Page 10 with the
List Limit set to 5:

### The Icons

* <span class="icon-angle-double-left"></span> Go to the *First* page.
* <span class="icon-angle-left"></span> Go to the *Previous* page.
* <span class="icon-angle-right"></span> Go to the *Next* page.
* <span class="icon-angle-double-right"></span> Go to the *Last* page

On page one the *First* page and *Previous* page icons are disabled. On the
last page the *Next* page and *Last* page icons are disabled.
