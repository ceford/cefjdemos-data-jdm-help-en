<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Edit_Schema / Display title: Edit Schema -->

## Purpose

Many components allow specification of schema data for each item. There is a
dropdown list of types:

* None
* Article
* BlogPosting
* Book
* Event
* JobPosting
* Organisation
* Person
* Recipe
* Custom

Each is a plugin which can be disabled or enabled as required for your site. 
More schema types my be added later or available from third party sources.

If the **None** option is selected there are no extra data to enter. Each of 
the other options requires entry of appropriate data. Some examples:
