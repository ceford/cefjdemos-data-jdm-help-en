## Edit Screens Permissions Tab

Many components allow specification of publishing date options for each item,
typically when to start or end publishing. Articles, Banners, Contacts and
perhaps more have a Publishing tab.

Item Metadata is also included in the Publishing tab. This takes priority over
Metadata in Menus or in the Global Configuration. It is important to complete
the Metadata description or your site may have many pages with the
same description. This could have an adverse effect on SEO.

## Example

The Articles Publishing tab:

to take appropriate action for the following fields:

	this item in less tha 64 characters.
- **Keywords** A feature of web pages abandoned by search engines years ago.
	Leave empty unless you have a specific application that uses them.
