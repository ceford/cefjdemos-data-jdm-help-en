The screenshots in each of the item type Help pages differ in details from
this screenshot.

## Form Fields

- **Menu Title** The title that will display for this menu item.
- **Alias** The internal name of the item. Normally, you can leave this
  blank and Joomla will fill in a default value Title in lower case and
  with dashes instead of spaces.

### Left Panel

- **Menu Item Type** The Menu Item Type selected when this menu item
  is created. This can be one of the core menu item types or a menu
  item type provided by an installed extension.
- **Menu Item** This field appears after selecting a menu item type. It allows
  selection of a menu from a popup dialogue for the link field.
- **Link** The system-generated link for this menu item. This field
  cannot be changed and is for information only.
- **Target Window** Select from the drop-down list.
- **Template Style** Select from the drop-down list.

### Right Panel

- **Menu** Shows which menu the link will appear in.
- **Parent Item** The parent menu item for this menu item. Used to
  determine whether a Menu Item is a top-level item or a submenu item.
  Select *- No Parent -* (the default value) if this is a top-level
  Menu Item. Otherwise, select the Menu Item that is this item's parent.
- **Ordering** Select *- First -* or *- Last -* or the item that this item
  should follow.
- **Status** The published status of the item.
- **Start Publishing** Date and time to start publishing. Use this
  field if you want to enter content ahead of time and then have it
  published automatically at a future time.
- **Finish Publishing** Date and time to finish publishing. Use this
  field if you want to have content automatically changed to Unpublished
  state at a future time (for example, when it is no longer applicable).
- **Default Page** If Yes, this menu item will be the default or home page
  for the site. There must be exactly one menu item set as the default page.
- **Access** The viewing Access  Level   for this item.
- **Language** Item language.
- **Note** This is normally for the site administrator's use (for
  example, to document information about this item) and does not show in
  the Frontend of the site.
