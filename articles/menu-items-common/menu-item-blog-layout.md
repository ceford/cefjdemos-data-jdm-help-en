## Form Fields

### Blog Layout tab

- **\# Leading Articles** Number of Articles to show using the full
  width of the main display area. `0` means that no Articles will show
  when using the full width. If an Article has a *Read more...* break,
  only the part of the text before the break (the Intro text) will
  display.
- **Leading Article Class** You can add any CSS class for your own
  styling ideas. Add a border on top with class boxed. For image position
  use for example image-start, image-end. Add image-alternate for
  alternate ordering of intro images.

  after the leading Article. These Articles will display in the number
