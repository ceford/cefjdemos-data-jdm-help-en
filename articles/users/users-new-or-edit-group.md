## Description

Joomla! is installed with set of User Groups suitable for management of
standard sites. The default groups should not be edited! New groups can
be created for special purposes. For example, you may wish to create a
group allowed access to one component only.

## How to access

- Select **Users → Groups** from the Administrator menu. Then...
  - Select the **New** button from the Toolbar. Or...
  - Select a link from the **Group Title** column to edit an existing
    group.

## User Group Details

- **Group Title** Enter a Title for the Group.
- **Group Parent** Choose a Parent for this Group. The new group inherits the
  permissions of the parent group.

## Quick tips

- If a new group will have similar permissions to an existing group, you
  can save work by making the new group a child of the existing group.
  That way, you only need to change the permissions that are different
  for the new group.
