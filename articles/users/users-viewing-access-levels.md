<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Users:_Viewing_Access_Levels / Display title: Users: Viewing Access Levels -->

## Description

Access levels control which users can view which assets on a site.
Assets include menu items, modules, categories, and component items
(articles, contacts, and so on). Each object in the site is assigned to
one access level. User groups are also assigned to each access level.

If a user is a member of a group that in turn has permission for an
access level, then that user can view all assets assigned to that
access level. It is important to understand that user groups can be
arranged in a parent-child hierarchy. If so, then a child group has
access to all access levels that the parent group has access to. So you
don't need to assign a child group access to levels that its parent
group already has access to.

The *Users: Viewing Access Levels* page shows a list of User Access Levels.
