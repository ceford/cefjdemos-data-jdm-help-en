## Form Fields

### Module Tab

#### Left Panel

- This changes from module to module.

#### Right Panel

- **Title** Show or hide the module's title in the front end.
- **Position** Choose the module position you wish this module to be displayed
  in. A custom module position can be entered for use with the load position
  plugin or the position button can be pressed to select a module position from
  the template.
- **Status** The published status of the item.
- **Access** The viewing Access Level for this item.
- **Module Ordering** This shows a drop down of every module in the
  position that the current module is in. This is the order that the
  modules will display in when displayed on in the front end as well as
  in the Modules page.
- **Start Publishing** Date and time to start publishing. Use this
  field if you want to enter content ahead of time and then have it
  published automatically at a future time.
- **Finish Publishing** Date and time to finish publishing. Use this
  field if you want to have content automatically changed to Unpublished
  state at a future time (for example, when it is no longer applicable).
- **Language** Item language. This is absent from Administrator modules.
- **Note** This is normally for the site administrator's use (for
  example, to document information about this item) and does not show in
  the Frontend of the site.
