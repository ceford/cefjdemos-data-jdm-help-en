## Modules

The sub-panels that make up the Home Dashboard illustrated above are
Administrator modules. Each can be unpublished via its configuration
icon or published via the list of administrator modules.

More modules can be added to suit the Administrator's purposes.

### Examples

#### Site panel

The left part of each icon links to the list of items. The right part,
the Plus symbol, links to the form to create a new item.

- **Users**
  Create/delete users, change passwords, modify language and time
  preferences, and switch which WYSIWYG editor the user has access to.
  You can also assign users to User Groups, limiting to which aspects of
  the site they have access to.
- **Articles**
  Manage all of your current articles.
- **Article Categories**
  Create new categories and publish or unpublish existing ones.
- **Media**
  Manage files on your web server. You can delete existing files or
  upload different ones from your hard drive. You can also create new
  directories on your web server's file system.
- **Modules**
  Control the location and function of modules that are installed on the
  site.
- **Plugins**
  Enable and disable plugins, edit a plugin's details and options.

#### System panel

- **Global Checkin**
  Check in currently pending or locked items.
- **Cache** Delete Cache files from the cache folders, including current ones.
- **Global Configuration**
  The global configuration page has parameters that affect the entire Joomla 
  site. This makes the Global Configuration perhaps one of the most important 
  areas in the Joomla Backend. Here many options can be changed, including, but 
  not limited to Time Zone, Language, Server Configuration, Session settings 
  and Meta Data.
