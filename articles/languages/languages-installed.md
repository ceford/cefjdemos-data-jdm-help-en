## List Filters

### Filter by Site or Administrator

- **Site** Shows the installed Languages for the site frontend. Select an 
  item from the Default column to set it as the default frontend language.
- **Administrator** Shows the installed Languages for the administrator 
  backend. Select an item from the Default column to set it as the default
  backend language.

## Quick Tips

- Users can use any Language from the list of installed Languages,
  either by having it assigned in the Users list or
  by filling out a Menu Item list - New/Edit - User Form
  Layout at the Frontend. This will cause the Joomla! system prompts to be
  generated in this Language just for this User. For example, if a User
  chooses Spanish as their language, then the Search Module will show
  with prompts in Spanish.
- This User's choice is not affected by the Default Language set for the
  Frontend.
- Changing a User's Language or the Default Language does not affect the
  website's Articles and other content.
- **Important**: Do not delete the default language files (for example,
  with FTP). This will create errors on both the Frontend and Backend.
- Additional Languages can be added using the Install Languages Screen.
- If desired, you can show the Frontend site in one Language and show
  the Backend administration pages in a different Language. Also,
  individual articles can be configured to use a different language in
  the Advanced Parameter pane when editing the Article.
