## Quick Tips

- Users can use any Language from the list of installed Languages,
  either by having it assigned in the User Profile
  or by filling out a Menu Items list - New/Edit - User  Form Layout
  at the Front end. This will cause the Joomla! system prompts to be
  generated in this Language just for this User. For example, if a User
  chooses Spanish as their language, then the Search Module will show
  with prompts in Spanish.
- This User's choice is not affected by the Default Language set for the
  Front-end.
- Changing a User's Language or the Default Language does not affect the
  web site's Articles and other content.
- **Important**: Do not delete the default language files (for example,
  with FTP). This will create errors on both the Front-end and Back-end.
- Additional Languages can be added using the Extensions - Install Screen.
- If desired, you can show the Front-end site in one Language and show
  the Back-end administration pages in a different Language. Also,
  individual articles can be configured to use a different language in
  the Advanced Parameter pane when editing the Article.
